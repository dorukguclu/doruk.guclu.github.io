            <ul>
                <li>Programming revolves around inputs and outputs, used daily in various contexts.</li>
                <li>Data is crucial in programming:
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is a collection of different or the same values stored in a place.</li>
                        <li>With inputs of data, we can produce outputs of data.</li>
                        <li>Outputs are results or expressions derived from data inputs.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>There are many programming languages, with Swift being one of the most important.</li>
                <li>Naming objects minimizes confusion, which is known as abstraction or identifiers:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identifying objects helps clarify their purpose, making debugging easier later on.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Camel case is the naming system used in Swift:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The first word remains lowercase.</li>
                        <li>The second word is capitalized, with no spaces between words.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>In programming, the value of a text is called a string, made up of characters:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The order of the characters in a string is important.</li>
                        <li>Variables are used to store changing objects:</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Variables must be declared first, indicating they are subject to change.</li>
                <li>Constants refer to values that are not meant to change.</li>
                <li>Values, constants, variables, and data can be used to create simulations:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Simulations recreate real-life scenarios.</li>
                        <li>By modeling with existing values and data, programmers can simulate variables and gather more data from these simulations.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Collaboration enhances thinking with more people, incorporating diverse perspectives and races without bias.</li>
                <li>Computing innovations can be both online or physical:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Why do they exist?</li>
                        <li>What problems do they solve?</li>
                        <li>What new capabilities do they provide that were previously unavailable?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Types of inputs include tactile, audio, visual, and text, and many devices accept different types of inputs.</li>
                <li>Outputs are triggered by inputs or code segments, functioning similarly to inputs but as results.</li>
                <li>A program is a collection of statements, containing code segments:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The working style of programs can differ.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Programs are developed by investigators who identify:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Constraints</li>
                        <li>User concerns and interests</li>
                        <li>Program requirements</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The development process involves:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Brainstorming</li>
                        <li>Storyboarding</li>
                        <li>Planning</li>
                        <li>Laying out the plan</li>
                        <li>Organizing and developing</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>A team of developers collaborates on programs, with each person having a specific role, and everyone deserving credit.</li>
                <li>Code segments used in development must be properly documented:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Documentation occurs at the beginning for listing specifications, during the project for tracking progress, and after the project to explain the overall process.</li>
                        <li>Some programming languages offer commenting, a form of documentation that doesn’t affect the code but helps future understanding.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Errors in programming are classified into 4 types:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Logic error: A mistake in the program or algorithm that causes the program to run incorrectly.</li>
                        <li>Syntax error: Similar to grammar errors, occur when the language rules aren’t followed.</li>
                        <li>Run-time error: Happens during the execution of the program, defined by each programming language.</li>
                        <li>Overflow error: Occurs when a computer tries to handle a number outside its defined range.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Syntax errors are typically easy to identify, as the language highlights the problematic line.</li>
                <li>Logic errors are the hardest to find and often require test cases:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Border cases (the limits of the code) are also important to test.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Hand tracing helps with loops by writing out variable values to determine the correctness of outcomes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hand tracing is used for small code segments, while larger segments may need debugging programs.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Visualizations or debuggers may be used if programs don’t work as expected.</li>
                <li>During the development process, testing involves:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using defined inputs to verify that an algorithm or program produces expected outcomes.</li>
                        <li>Programs are tested with inputs at or beyond the extremes of input data.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Testing process:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Programmers test right after developing the program.</li>
                        <li>Once inputs and outputs are determined, they test, edit, and retest the program continuously.</li>
                        <li>After programmer testing, users test the program to refine it further.</li>
                        <li>Once refined, the program is finally released.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!-- New Section: Big Idea 2 -->
        <section>
            <h2>Big Idea 2</h2>
            <p>Binary system is made up of 2 digits; 0 and 1. 1 Means on and 0 means off.

 Bit is short for the term binary digit.		A byte means 8 bits.

There are billions of transistors in a computer, reflecting electrical signals which are meant either 0 or 1

All information stored in our devices are made up of 0 and 1 sequences, which those numbers actually are instructions.

Abstraction reduces complexity and allows us to focus on the main idea or problem

The sue of digital data to approximate real world analog data is en example of abstraction

Sampling is a measure of the value of the analog signal at regular intervals. They are used to find out how much bits are exactly need to store the analog data in the digital form.

Integers are represented in a fixed number of bits. Some programming language store up to 32 bits, which is 4 bytes. 4 bytes can represent over 4 billion values in total

If a program encounters a number which is bigger than the program’s storage space, it can result in an overflow error

Some languages can have problems about real numbers like pi, which is a round-up error

The more bits we have, the more integers we can represent

Constructing a binary number is figuring out which power of 2 add up to the number

￼

Data compression is a reduction in the number of bits needed to represent data. It is used to save time and space

Remove all repeated characters and put a symbol or a single character in its place

Lossless compression data is the number of bits stored or transmitted while guaranteeing complete reconstruction of the original data. It is typically used for executable and spreadsheet flies and text

Lossy compression data significantly reduces the number of bits to allow the reconstruction of approximate original data. It is used for graphics, audio, or images

While collecting data, we need to consider the source and the tools to analyze the data

While processing data is affected by size, we need to consider how much info we can get, whether anyone's computer handles our tasks, do we need to use two or more processors to handle different parts of the tasks, do we need to check the scalability of the system?

While collecting data, there could be potential bias. We need to know who collected the data and do they have an agenda. We also need to look out for how data is collected.

We may need to clean incomplete, corrupt, duplicate, or inaccurate data records. Or we may need to replace modify or delete dirty data. While doing these, we need to be sure there's a mistake, and we need to keep a record of why data is modified or deleted.

Metadata is a prefix, which means behind among and between. It essentially means data about data. 

Some data has information about itself like author, date, and length or size. This information are kept to track organize, process, and identify data

Metadata is used by many terms, mainly to suggest.

Using programs data can be stored in types of lists to be processed.

After filtering and cleaning the data users can utilize the program to interact with the data to gain insight and knowledge.

Users can filter, sort, combine, transform, cluster, and classify data.
