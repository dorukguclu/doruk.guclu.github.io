        <p>Collaboration makes us think with more people, with more perspectives and races, without bias.

A computing innovation may be online or physical.

We need to ask essential questions to understand computing innovations;
Why do they exist, what do they solve and what do they make us do that wasn’t available before.

There are multiple types of inputs such as tactile, audio, visual, and text.

A lot of different devices accept different types of inputs.

It is the same with outputs, but they are triggered by outputs or code segments.

A program is a collection of statements.

Code segments are found in programs, and programs’ working styles differ.

Programs are developed with investigators, whom they need to determine the constraints, user concerns and interests, and the requirements of a program.

Developers brainstorm, storyboard, plan, lay out the plan, organize and develop.

A team of people develops programs, everybody has a role on the team and each member deserves credit just like how we credit our work as individuals.

Many developers use code segments and when it is used, it must be documented.

Documentation happens at the beginning for listing specifications, during the project for keeping track of progress after the project to explain the overall process.

Some of the programming languages offer commenting which is a form of documentation and that could be very useful for you to understand your code later, it doesn’t affect the code.

We need to identify the type of error because there are 4 types:
Logic error; is a mistake in the program or in the algorithm which means that the program isn’t running as expected or incorrectly.
Syntax errors; like grammar errors because the rules of the language are not followed.
Run-time error; happens during the execution of the program and it is defined by each programming language, by the language itself.
Overflow error; Occurs when a computer tries to handle a number that isn’t defined in the range.

When we encounter a syntax error, it is easy to understand and the language tells us which line has the problem.

Logic errors are the hardest to find. They may not be seen at first sight, so that’s why programmers use test cases to find logic error.

Border cases are also important to test, which are the limits of the code.

Hand tracing can be useful with loops. It is simply writing out the values of the variables in the loop to determine the correctness of the outcome. It is used for small code segments and larger code segments usually need debugging programs. 
 If they don’t work at all, visualizations or debuggers are likely to be used. 

In the development process testing, uses defined inputs to ensure that an algorithm or program is producing the expected outcomes.

Define inputs to test, the program should demonstrate to us how the different expected outcomes are at, or just beyond the extremes of input data.

Some program requirements are needed to identify the right inputs just for testing.

Programmers start testing right after developing the program.

Once the input and outputs are determined, programmers just test a lot and after testing with the results, they edit the program again and test the program again and again.

After the programmers, they have users testing the program and the program is refined even more. After that, the program is finally released</p>
