            <h2>College Board Notes</h2>
            <p>Collaboration enhances thinking with more people, incorporating diverse perspectives and races without bias.</p>
            <p>Computing innovations can be both online or physical.</p>
                <p>Essential questions to ask about computing innovations include:</p>
                    <p>Why do they exist?</p>
                    <p>What problems do they solve?</p>
                    <p>What new capabilities do they provide that were previously unavailable?</p>
            <p>Types of inputs include tactile, audio, visual, and text, and many devices accept different types of inputs.</p>
            <p>Outputs are triggered by inputs or code segments, functioning similarly to inputs but as results.</p>
            <p>A program is a collection of statements, containing code segments.</p>
                <p>The working style of programs can differ.</p>
            <p>Programs are developed by investigators who identify:</p>
                <p>Constraints</p>
                <p>User concerns and interests</p>
                <p>Program requirements</p>
            <p>The development process involves:</p>
                <p>Brainstorming</p>
                <p>Storyboarding</p>
                <p>Planning</p>
                <p>Laying out the plan</p>
                <p>Organizing and developing</p>
            <p>A team of developers collaborates on programs, with each person having a specific role, and everyone deserving credit.</p>
            <p>Code segments used in development must be properly documented:</p>
                <p>Documentation occurs at:</p>
                    <p>The beginning is for listing specifications.</p>
                    <p>During the project, for tracking progress.</p>
                    <p>After the project, explain the overall process.</p>
                <p>Some programming languages offer commenting, a form of documentation that doesn’t affect the code but helps future understanding.</p>
            <p>Errors in programming are classified into 4 types:</p>
                <p>Logic error: A mistake in the program or algorithm that causes the program to run incorrectly.</p>
                <p>Syntax error: Similar to grammar errors, occur when the language rules aren’t followed.</p>
                <p>Run-time error: This happens during the execution of the program, defined by each programming language.</p>
                <p>Overflow error: Occurs when a computer tries to handle a number outside its defined range.</p>
            <p>Syntax errors are typically easy to identify, as the language highlights the problematic line.</p>
            <p>Logic errors are the hardest to find and often require test cases.</p>
                <p>Border cases (the limits of the code) are also important to test.</p>
            <p>Hand tracing helps with loops by writing out variable values to determine the correctness of outcomes.</p>
                <p>Hand tracing is used for small code segments, while larger segments may need debugging programs.</p>
            <p>Visualizations or debuggers may be used if programs don’t work as expected.</p>
            <p>During the development process, testing involves:</p>
                <p>Using defined inputs to verify that an algorithm or program produces expected outcomes.</p>
                <p>Programs are tested with inputs at or beyond the extremes of input data.</p>
            <p>Testing process:</p>
                <p>Programmers test right after developing the program.</p>
                <p>Once inputs and outputs are determined, they test, edit, and retest the program continuously.</p>
                <p>After programmer testing, users test the program to refine it further.</p>
                <p>Once refined, the program is finally released.</p>

            <h2>Swift Learning</h2>
            <p>Programming revolves around inputs and outputs, used daily in various contexts.</p>
            <p>Data is crucial in programming:</p>
                <p>It is a collection of different or the same values stored in a place.</p>
                <p>With inputs of data, we can produce outputs of data.</p>
                <p>Outputs are results or expressions derived from data inputs.</p>
            <p>There are many programming languages, with Swift being one of the most important.</p>
            <p>Naming objects minimizes confusion, which is known as abstraction or identifiers.</p>
                <p>Identifying objects helps clarify their purpose, making debugging easier later on.</p>
            <p>Camel case is the naming system used in Swift:</p>
                <p>The first word remains lowercase.</p>
                <p>The second word is capitalized, with no spaces between words.</p>
            <p>In programming, the value of a text is called a string, made up of characters:</p>
                <p>The order of the characters in a string is important.</p>
                <p>Variables are used to store changing objects:</p>
            <p>Variables must be declared first, indicating they are subject to change.</p>
            <p>Constants refer to values that are not meant to change.</p>
            <p>Values, constants, variables, and data can be used to create simulations:</p>
                <p>Simulations recreate real-life scenarios.</p>
                <p>By modeling with existing values and data, programmers can simulate variables and gather more data from these simulations.</p>
