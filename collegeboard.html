        <p>Collaboration makes us think with more people, with more perspectives and more races, without any kinds of bias

A computing innovation may be online or pyhsical

We need to ask essential questions to understand computing innovations;
Why do they exist, what do they solve and what do they make us do that wasn’t available before

There are multiple types of inputs such as tactile, audio, visual and text

A lot of different devices accept different types of inputs

It is the same with outputs, but they are triggered by outputs or code segments

A program is a collection of statements

Code segments are found in programs, and programs’ working style differ 

Programs are developed with investigators, whom they need to determine the constraints, user concerns and interests and the requirements of a program

Developers brainstorm, storyboard, plan, lay out the plan, organize and develop

Programs are developed by a team of people, everybody has a role on the team and each member deserves credit just like how we credit our work as individuals 

Many developers use code segments and when it is used, it must be documented

Documentation happens at the beginning for listing specifications, during the project for keeping track of progress after the project to explain the overall process

Some of the programing languages offer commenting and it is a form of documentation and it could be very useful for yourself to understand your code later, it doesn’t affect the code</p>
