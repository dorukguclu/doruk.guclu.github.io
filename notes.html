            <h2>College Board Notes</h2>
            <p>Collaboration makes us think with more people, with more perspectives and races, without bias. A computing innovation may be online or physical. We need to ask essential questions to understand computing innovations: Why do they exist? What do they solve? What do they enable that wasnâ€™t available before?</p>
            <p>There are multiple types of inputs such as tactile, audio, visual, and text. Many devices accept different types of inputs. The same is true for outputs, which are triggered by outputs or code segments. A program is a collection of statements. Code segments are found in programs, and the way programs work differs. Programs are developed with investigators who need to determine constraints, user concerns, and requirements.</p>
            <p>Programs are developed by a team, with everyone having a role, and all deserving credit. Code segments must be documented. Documentation happens throughout the process: at the start, during, and after. Commenting is a form of documentation that helps understand code later on. It does not affect the code itself.</p>
            <p>There are four types of errors: Logic errors (program runs incorrectly), Syntax errors (rules not followed), Run-time errors (occur during execution), and Overflow errors (data exceeds range). Logic errors are the hardest to detect, often requiring test cases. Hand tracing with loops can help debug smaller segments. Larger segments require debuggers.</p>
            <p>Testing uses defined inputs to ensure a program produces expected outputs. Programmers start testing right after developing the program and continually test and refine it until it works as expected.</p>

            <h2>Swift Learning</h2>
            <p>Programming is all about inputs and outputs. We encounter them every day in our lives. Data is crucial. It is a collection of values, and with inputs of data, we get outputs of data. Outputs are results or expressions.</p>
            <p>There are many programming languages, and one of the most important is Swift. Naming objects reduces confusion, and in Swift, this is called Camel Case (capitalizing the second word, no spaces). Strings are values of text, and they are made up of characters. Their order matters a lot.</p>
            <p>If objects change, they are called variables. Variables need to be declared so the computer knows they may change. If they do not change, they are constants. Values, constants, variables, and data allow us to create simulations, which model real-life scenarios and help programmers gain more data by simulating variables.</p>
