        <p>Programming is all about inputs and outputs. There are many ways of inputs and outputs and we use them everyday in our lives.

Data is crucial. It is a collection of different or the same values in a place. With inputs of data, we get outputs of data. Outputs are kinds of results or expressions.

There are many programming languages; one of the most important is Swift. 

We need to name objects to minimize confusion, which is called an abstraction. Or as identifiers. If we identify the objects we want to clarify, then it will be easier when debugging the code later on. 
The naming system in Swift is called the Camel case, which stands for capitalizing the second word if there is one, keeping the first lowercase and with no spaces.

The value of a text is called a string in many programming languages, including Swift. Strings are made up of characters. The order of the characters matters a lot.

If we have changing objects, we call them variables. We need to declare the variables at first and let the computer know that the variable is subject to change. If the subject is not to change, then we call that value a constant.

These values, constants, variables, and data can help us to create a simulation. Trying to recreate real-life scenarios. By modeling with the information of values and data we have, we can create those scenarios and help programmers
to gain more data by just simulating some variables.</p>
